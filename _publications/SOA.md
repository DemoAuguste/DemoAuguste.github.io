**Abstract** - As for SOA software, architecture based reliability prediction analysis at the early stage of software development can provide useful information to help developers in improving the design quality. Software architecture model is the modeling basis of SOA software reliability prediction, which is one of the essential elements determining the prediction validity and accuracy. In current researches of software architecture modeling, dynamic changes of SOA structure and dynamic nature of services during runtime are not fully considered. In this paper, we proposed an architecture-based SOA software extended modeling method considering reliability information. This proposed model consists of two main parts: static part and dynamic part. Static part is the structural basis of overall model. The dynamic changes of SOA structure and dynamic nature of services are depicted and modeled in the dynamic part. This method is the modeling basis of further SOA software reliability prediction and analysis.
